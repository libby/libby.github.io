I like good people, coding, pickles, coffee, cheese, chocolate, snowboarding, tennis, music, learning random things, etc. I live in BK but will travel for fun and adventures.\r\n\r\nI self-identify as a Scala programmer, which was my gateway drug to functional programming.  Drinking deep from the FP well has caused me to visit the land of Haskell which, albeit intimidating at first, proved to be a rewarding visit. I've been addicted to [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) for years, and feel fortunate that there are so many knowledgeable people out there who enthusiastically share their knowledge. Thanks to all the people who have taught me and continue to teach me along the way! :beer: I raise my glass to you. And yes, I like beer too.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat languages\r\nScala\r\nJava\r\nPython\r\nJavascript\r\nRuby\r\nHaskell\r\nOctave (thanks to Andrew Ng)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat countries_lived\r\nU.S.A.\r\nSpain\r\nGuatemala\r\nNetherlands (Breda)\r\nChile\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
